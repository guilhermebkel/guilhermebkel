### Hi there 👋

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guilhermebkel/gbkel-portfolio/master/logo.png" align="right" width="90">

I'm currently focused on the Javascript ecosystem, but occasionally you will see me giving stars all around the github repositories.

I also write some notes about what I'm learning on my [learning-notes](https://about.guilherr.me/learning-notes) repo.

Last but not least, you're able to know more about me on my [life-long-road](https://about.guilherr.me) repo.
