# Hi there 👋

My name is Guilherme Mota. I'm a full-stack developer (with knowledge on devops/design as well) currently working as a Tech Lead at PICSIZE.

I'm currently focused on the Javascript ecosystem, but occasionally you will see me giving stars all around the github repositories.


## 👨‍💻 Current Projects

On part of my free time I like to stay focused in some personal projects just for fun/curiosity.

> 💎 [Personal Website](https://guilherr.me) - My personal website which I use to show some info about me technically/personally.

> 🎴 [Uno Game](https://uno.guilherr.me) - A remake of Uno Game that I have made in Javascript.
