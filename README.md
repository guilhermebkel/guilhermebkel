# Hi there 👋

My name is Guilherme Mota. I'm currently a Tech Lead at @Letalk. I'm working mostly with Node.js, Typescript and React.js but I love to know about everything that revolves around technology, so I have some knowledge about Devops and Design as well.

I'm also passionate about open source, so occasionally you will see me giving stars all around the github repositories and developing new projects.


## 👨‍💻 Current Projects

In part of my free time I like to stay focused on some personal projects just for fun/curiosity.

> 💎 [Personal Website](https://github.com/guilhermebkel/gbkel-portfolio) - My personal website which I use to show some info about me technically/personally.
>
> 🎴 [Uno Game](https://github.com/guilhermebkel/uno-game) - A remake of Uno Game that I have made in Javascript.
>
> 📒 [Notes](https://github.com/guilhermebkel/gbkel-notes) - The notes I take from books and articles I'm currently reading.
>
> 📑 [Kindlefy](https://github.com/gbkel/kindlefy) - A github action to sync all kind of contents with kindle.
> >
> 💭 [Alexa Skills](https://github.com/guilhermebkel/alexa-skills) - A bunch of alexa skills I've created to automatize actions in my day-to-day life.
